==============================================================================
1. Introduction                     *wilder-introduction*

wilder.nvim adds new features to 'wildmenu'.
Features include

1. Automatically provides completions as you type
2. |/| search support: get completions as you type your search query
3. Customisable pipeline: e.g. choose between substring matching and fuzzy
   matching
4. Async query support: use |python3| for faster and non-blocking queries
5. Customisable themes

==============================================================================
2. Install                          *wilder-install*

Requirements:

- Vim 8.1+ or Neovim 0.3+
- Certain features (e.g. async, cmdline completion) are only enabled in Neovim
- Default async search needs Python 3 enabled

==============================================================================
3. Options                          *wilder-options*

Options can be set using the |wilder#set_option| function.

                                    *wilder#set_option()*
wilder#set_option({name}, {value})
            Sets the option {name} to the given {value}.
            E.g.
>
            call wilder#set_option('foo', 'bar')
<

wilder#set_option({dict})
            For each {key}-{value} pair of the |Dictionary|, sets the option
            {key} to the given {value}.
>
            call wilder#set_option({'foo': 'bar'})
<


modes                               *wilder-option-modes*
            List of modes which wilder will be active in.
            Possible elements: '/', '?' and ':'

            Default: ['/', '?']

use_cmdlinechanged                  *wilder-option-use_cmdlinechanged*
            If true, wilder will refresh queries when the |CmdlineChanged|
            autocommand is triggered.
            Otherwise it will use a |timer| to check whether the cmdline has
            changed.
            Using a timer will be more resource intensive.

            Default: exists('##CmdlineChanged')

interval                            *wilder-option-interval*
            Interval of the |timer| used to check whether the cmdline has
            changed, in milliseconds.
            Only applicable if |wilder-option-use_cmdlinechanged| is false.

            Default: 100

before_cursor                       *wilder-option-before_cursor*
            If true, wilder will look only at the part of the cmdline before
            the cursor, and when selecting a completion, the entire cmdline
            will be replaced.
            Only applicable if |wilder-option-use_cmdlinechanged| is false.

            Default: 0

num_workers                         *wilder-option-num_workers*
            Number of workers for the Python 3 |remote-plugin|.
            Has to be set at startup, before wilder is first run. Setting the
            option after the first run has no effect.

            Default: 2

pipeline                            *wilder-option-pipeline*
            Sets the pipeline to use to get completions.
            See |wilder-pipeline|.

            Default: |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()| and
                     |wilder#search_pipeline()| for Vim
                     |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()| and
                     |wilder#python_search_pipeline()| for Neovim with
                                                       Python 3 support

renderer                            *wilder-option-renderer*
            Sets the renderer to used to display the completions.
            See |wilder-renderer|.

            Default: |wilder#statusline_renderer()| with
                     |wilder#previous_arrow()| and |wilder#next_arrow()|

pre_hook                            *wilder-option-pre_hook*
            A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
            wilder starts, or when wilder becomes unhidden. See
            |wilder-hidden|.

            {ctx} contains no keys.

            Default: None

post_hook                           *wilder-option-post_hook*
            A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
            wilder stops, or when wilder becomes hidden. See
            |wilder-hidden|.

            {ctx} contains no keys.

            Default: None

==============================================================================
4. Pipeline                         *wilder-pipeline*

The pipeline is used to get completions from a given query. Use
|wilder-option-pipeline| to set the pipeline.

A pipeline is a function or  list of functions. When it is a function, it is
implicitly converted to a list with its only element being the function.

Each function in the list should take a {ctx} context object and a {x} value
and return a new {x} value. The resulting {x} is then passed to the next
function in the list. The first element is passed the current cmdline. The
result of the last element will be the completions for that query. See
|wilder-pipeline-context| for what {ctx} contains.

A contrived example:
>
    wilder#set_option('pipeline', [
      \   {ctx, x -> [x, 'foo', 'bar']},
      \   ])
<
This will return the 3 completions, the current cmdline and the strings 'foo'
and 'bar'.

The result of the pipeline should be a list of strings or a dictionary. For
the dictionary, the 'value' value should be a list of strings. See
|wilder-pipeline-result| for more details on other keys the dictionary
contain, and see |wilder-pipeline-flow| for more details on how the result
will be used.

There are 3 special types of values, which when returned in the middle of the
pipeline, will cause the pipeline to stop. These are `v:false` `v:true` and
functions. See |wilder-pipeline-v:false|, |wilder-pipeline-v:true| and
|wilder-pipeline-thunk| for more details on what these special values mean,
and how theye are handled.

A component can throw an exception which will also cause the pipeline to stop.

wilder provides some built-in pipeline functions, known as pipeline
components. Combine these components with your own functions to create a
custom pipeline. In particular, use |wilder#branch| to add control flow to
your pipeline. See |wilder-pipeline-components| for the list of components.

wilder also provides built-in pipelines. These pipelines can be combined with
|wilder#branch|. See |wilder-pipelines| for the list of pipelines.

                                    *wilder-pipeline-context*
The first argument to a pipeline component is a {ctx} context object. The
context is a |Dictionary| containing the following keys:

                `input`
                The input to the first element of the pipeline.

                `run_id`
                A number to indicate the current pipeline running.

Although it is not recommended, components can use the {ctx} to pass
information to subsequent components.

                                    *wilder-pipeline-v:false*
Returning the |v:false| in a pipeline component will cause the pipeline to
stop and return |v:false|. |v:false| indicates to wilder to not continue on
with the pipeline, and treat it as though there are no completions. use this
to return early from a pipeline based on certain conditions.

Example:
>
    wilder#set_option('pipeline', [
      \   {ctx, x -> empty(x) ? v:false : x},
      \   {ctx, x -> MyCompletionFunction(x)},
      \   ]
<
This pipeline will terminate early if the cmdline is empty.
Since this is a common pattern, it is provided as the |wilder#check()|
component.

                                    *wilder-pipeline-v:true*
                                    *wilder-hidden*
Returning the |v:true| in a pipeline component is the same as returning
|v:true|, except that it has the added behaviour of causing wilder to be
hidden. When wilder is hidden, |wilder#in_context()| will return false, and
wilder will not be rendered. Note that wilder is still enabled, and will still
be handle completions and be shown again when the next pipeline returns a
non-|v:true| value.

                                    *wilder-pipeline-thunk*
Returning a function {f} in a pipeline component will cause the pipeline to be
suspended. The function is called a thunk. The thunk will then be called with
a new {ctx}. Use the thunk to call async code.

After the async code has finished running, |wilder#resolve()| should be caled
with {ctx} and the result {x} as arguments. The original {ctx} from the parent
function can be ignored. The pipeline will then be resumed, and the {x} value
will be passed on to the next component.

If there is an error, |wilder#reject()| should be called instead, with {ctx}
and {error} as arguments.

If the result of a thunk is another thunk, the result thunk will be called.
The pipeline will resume when one of the thunks eventually returns a
non-function result.

Note: exactly one of |wilder#resolve()| or |wilder#reject()| has to be called
eventually. Not calling either will result in a memory leak, and calling more
than one will result in an error.

Example:
>
    wilder#set_option('pipeline', [
      \   {_, x -> {ctx -> timer_start(100, {-> wilder#resolve(ctx, x)})}},
      \   {ctx, x -> MyCompletionFunction(x)},
      \   ]
<
This will call `MyCompletionFunction` after a 100 millisecond delay.

Use this behaviour to create async pipeline components.

                                    *wilder-pipeline-result*
The result of the pipeline should be a list of strings or a dictionary. For
the dictionary, the 'value' value should be a list of strings.

When the result is a list, it is implicitly converted into a dictionary with
the list of keys under the 'value' key.

The result dictionary allows you to change how the candidate is handled. For
example, you may wish to escape certain characters when drawing the candidate
or only change certain parts of the cmdline when the candidate is selected.

The Result dictionary has the following keys:

            `value`                 *wilder-pipeline-result-value*
            Mandatory~
            The list of candidates as strings

            `data`                  *wilder-pipeline-result-data*
            Optional~
            A dictionary containing arbitrary data. Will be passed to the
            `draw`, `output` and `replace` functions when they are called. If
            not set, will default to an empty dictionary.

            `draw`                  *wilder-pipeline-result-draw*
            Optional~
            A list of strings or functions which takes a {ctx}, {x} and {data}
            and returns a string representing how {x} will be drawn by the
            renderer.
            For each element in the list, if the element is a string, it is
            converted to a function using |function()|.
            {ctx} and {x} are passed to the function and the result is the new
            value of {x}. {ctx} and the new value of {x} is then passed to the
            next element until there are no further elements.

            The keys of {ctx} are:
                `selected`
                The index of the selected candidate. -1 indicates no
                selection.

                `i`
                The index of the {x} in the list of candidates.

            See |wilder-pipeline-result-data| on how {data} is gotten.

            Default: None

            `output`                *wilder-pipeline-result-output*
            Optional~
            A list of strings or functions which takes a {ctx}, {x} and {data}
            and returns a string representing how {x} will be output when
            selected as a completion candidate.
            See the |wilder-pipeline-result-draw| option for how iterating
            through the list works.

            {ctx} has no keys.

            See |wilder-pipeline-result-data| on how {data} is gotten.

            Default: None

            `replace`               *wilder-pipeline-result-replace*
            Optional~
            A list of strings or functions which takes a {ctx}, {x} and {data}
            and returns the cmdline to replace the current one.
            See |wilder-option-before_cursor| on which part of the cmdline will be
            replaced.
            See the |wilder-pipeline-result-draw| option for how iterating
            through the list works.

            The keys of {ctx} are:
                `cmdline`
                The cmdline which was replaced. This value should be used
                instead of |getcmdline()| as the current cmdline may have
                changed.

            See |wilder-pipeline-result-data| on how {data} is gotten.

            Default: None

                                    *wilder-pipeline-flow*
1. The pipeline starts with the current cmdline as the input

2. The pipeline finishes with a list of strings or a dictionary {result}.

3. The list of strings is implicitly converted into a result dictionary with
   the list of strings under the `value` key.

4. Each element of the `value` list {x} is drawn by the renderer:
   If {result} does not contain the key `draw`, its {x} entry is used.
   Otherwise, |wilder-pipeline-result-draw| is applied. The result is then
   passed to the renderer.

5. When a candidate {x} is selected, its value can be modified before
   inserting it to the cmdline.
   If {result} does not contain the key `output`, its {x} entry is used.
   Otherwise, |wilder-pipeline-result-output| is applied. The result is then
   used for insertion to the cmdline.

6. Finally, the output from above will be inserted to the cmdline.
   See |wilder-option-before_cursor| on which part of the cmdline will be
   replaced.
   If {result} does not contain the key `output`, its {x} entry is used.
   Otherwise, |wilder-pipeline-result-output| is applied. The result is then
   used to replace the cmdline.

The |wilder#result()| pipeline component is a helper component which allows
easy modification of the result dictionary.

COMPONENTS                          *wilder-pipeline-components*

wilder#check({f}, ...)              *wilder#check()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a variadic list of functions. The functions should take
            {ctx} and {x} as arguments and return true or false.
            If any of the functions return false, this component will return
            |v:false|.
            Returns {x} otherwise.

wilder#branch({list_of_pipelines})  *wilder#branch()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a list of pipelines. The pipelines should be a list of
            components.
            Sequentially runs each of the pipelines, using the {ctx} and {x}
            passed to the branch component.
            {ctx} is copied, and will not be shared between the pipelines.
            If the result of a pipeline is |v:false|, the next pipeline will
            be run.
            If the result of a pipeline is a non-|v:false| value {x}, this
            component will return {x}.
            If the result of all  the pipelines are |v:false|, this component
            will return |v:false|.
            Use this to add control flow to pipelines.

            Example:
>
                wilder#set_option('pipeline', [
                  \   wilder#branch(
                  \     [
                  \       wilder#check({ctx, x -> empty(x)}),
                  \       wilder#history(),
                  \     ],
                  \     wilder#search_pipeline(),
                  \   ),
                  \   ]
<
            This pipeline will return completions from the history is {x} is
            empty.

                                    *wilder#history()*
wilder#history([{max_num}, [{cmdtype}]])
                                    Pipeline component~
            A component which returns up to {max_num} values from the
            |history| of {cmdtype}.
            By default, {max_num} is treated as 50.
            Passing zero or a negative value of {max_num} will result in no
            limit.
            By default, {cmdtype} is the value of |getcmdtype()|.
            See |hist-names| for the possible values of {cmdtype}

wilder#vim_substring()              *wilder#vim_substring()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a string and appends it with a substring regex.

wilder#vim_search([{options}])      *wilder#vim_search()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a regex and searches the current buffer for completions
            matching the regex. Returns a list of unique strings.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `max_candidates`
            Maximum number of candidates to return.
            0 or less sets no limit.

            Default: 300

wilder#vim_sort()                   *wilder#vim_sort()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a list and returns a sorted copy of the list.

wilder#vim_uniq()                   *wilder#vim_uniq()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a list and returns a uniq-ed copy of the list.

wilder#python_substring()           *wilder#python_substring()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a string and appends it with a Python substring regex.

                                    *wilder#python_fuzzy_match()*
                                    Pipeline component~
wilder#python_fuzzy_match([{options}])
            Takes a string and converts it into a Python fuzzy regex.
            The string is split into characters and the fuzzy regex for `word`
            is added in between each character.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `word`
            Word character for the Python regex.

            Default: '\w'

                                    *wilder#python_fuzzy_delimiter()*
wilder#python_fuzzy_delimiter([{options}])
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a string and converts it to a Python regex by splitting the
            string into characters. Each character either follows directly
            from the previous one, or is the start of a delimited region.
            The start of a delimited region is either
            1. a `delimiter` character followed by a character
            2. An uppercase character

            e.g.
            `fb` matches `FooBar`, `foo_bar`, `fooBar`
                 but not `foobar` since `bar` is not delimited

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `word`
            Python regex for word characters

            Default: '\w'

            `delimiter`
            Python regex for delimiter characters

            Default: '[_-]'

wilder#python_search([{options}])   *wilder#python_search()*
                                    Neovim only~
                                    Async~
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a regex and searches the current buffer for completions
            matching the regex using Python 3.
            Returns a list of unique strings.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `max_candidates`
            Maximum number of candidates to return.
            0 or less sets no limit.

            Default: 300

            `engine`
            Regex engine to use. Has to be compatible with Python 3's `re`
            module.
            For faster completions, `re2` is recommended, but needs to be
            installed.

            Default: 're'

wilder#python_sort()                *wilder#python_sort()*
                                    Neovim only~
                                    Async~
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a list and returns a sorted copy of the list.

wilder#python_uniq()                *wilder#python_uniq()*
                                    Neovim only~
                                    Async~
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a list and returns a uniq-ed copy of the list.

wilder#result([{dictionary}])       *wilder#result()*
                                    Pipeline component~
            Takes a dictionary and returns a component which will transform
            the {input} into a result dictionary and modifies its keys. See
            |wilder-pipeline-result| for more information on how the keys of
            the dictionary is used.

            For each {key} and {value} pair in {dictionary}: If {value} is a
            list, and {input} does not contain {key}, {input}'s {key} is
            mapped to the list. Otherwise, the list is appended to the end of
            the list at {input}'s {key}.

            If {value} is a dictionary, and {input} does not contain {key},
            {input}'s {key} is mapped to the dictionary. Otherwise, the
            dictionary at {input}'s {key} is extended with the dictionary
            using |extend()|.

            If {value} is a function, it should be a function which takes a
            {ctx}, {old_value} and {data} and returns the new value to be
            used, or a |wilder-pipeline-thunk| which returns the new value. If
            {input} does not contain {key}, {old_value} will be |v:null|.
            {data} is the entry for {input}'s `data` key, or an empty
            dictionary if the key `data` does not exist. This can be used to
            pass arbitrary data to the functions being called.

            If {value} is none of the above, the value at {input}'s {key} will
            be mapped to {value}.

            For example:
>
            [
            \ {ctx, x -> MyCompletionFunction(x)},
            \ wilder#result({'draw': [{ctx, x -> (ctx['i'] + 1) . '. ' . x}]}),
            \ wilder#result({'draw': [{ctx, x -> ctx['selected']
            \                         ? '[' . x . ']' : x)}]}),
            \ ]
<
            This pipeline will first prepend the index of the candidate and
            then surround it with square brackets if it is currently selected.


                                    *wilder#result_output_escape()*
wilder#result_output_escape({chars})
                                    Pipeline component~
            Helper function which returns a |wilder#result()| which escapes
            {chars} in the `output` when selecting a candidate. See
            |wilder-pipeline-flow| on how `output` is used.

            Handles user command completions, file completions and cmdline
            completions.
            For completions during |:substitute|, use
            |wilder#substitute_pipeline()|.

            Note: Custom completions for user commands are only available in
            Neovim. Wilder will be hidden when attempting to complete user
            command completions in Vim. See |wilder-hidden|.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `fuzzy`
            When true, use fuzzy matching for the results.
            Note: Fuzzy matching does not work in some cases, e.g. when
            getting |help| completions, when completing filenames with
            |wildcards| or user-defined command completions
            |:command-completion|.

            filtered candidates. Can return a |wilder-pipeline-thunk|.
            Only used if `fuzzy` is true.

            Default: |wilder#python_fuzzy_filter()| if `use_python` is true
                     |wilder#fuzzy_filter()| otherwise

            `hide_in_substitute`
            When true, hides wilder when in a |:substitute| command.

            Returns a pipeline which runs the given pipeline when in a
            |:substitute| command.
            Uses the {pattern} section of the command as the argument.

            Note |wilder#substitute_pipeline()| should be placed in front of
            |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()| when using |wilder#branch()| if
            `hide_in_substitute` is true.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `pipeline`
            The pipeline to pass the {pattern} section to.
            |wilder#vim_search_pipeline()| and
            |wilder#python_search_pipeline()| can be used as the pipeline if
            the `skip_check` option is set for the pipelines.

            Default: For vim:
                     wilder#vim_search_pipeline({'skip_check' : 1}
                     For nvim:

5. Renderer                         *wilder-renderer*

The renderer is used to draw wilder and the completion candidates on the
screen. Use |wilder-option-renderer| to set the renderer.

A renderer is a dictionary containing the following keys:

            `render`
            Mandatory~
            A function which takes a {ctx} and the pipeline result {result}
            and does the necessary actions to draw the results on the screen.

            The keys of {ctx} are:
                `selected`
                The index of the selected candidate. -1 indicates no selection.

                `direction`
                A number to indicate the whether the previous candidate or the
                next candidate was selected. 1 indicates the next candidate,
                -1 indicates the previous candidate, 0 indicates that there
                was no change.

                `done`
                A boolean to indicate whether the current pipeline has finished.

                `has_error`
                True if the pipeline resulted in an error.

                `clear_previous`
                A boolean to indicate whether the previous state should be
                cleared.

            `pre_hook`
            Optional~
            A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
            wilder starts, or when wilder becomes unhidden. See
            |wilder-hidden|.

            {ctx} contains no keys.

            `post_hook`
            Optional~
            A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
            wilder stops, or when wilder becomes hidden. See
            |wilder-hidden|.

            {ctx} contains no keys.

There are two in-built renderers, one using the statusline and one using a
floating window.

                                    *wilder#statusline_renderer()*
wilder#statusline_renderer([{options}])
                                    Renderer~
            Returns a renderer which draws the results on the statusline of
            the current window.

            Note: The statusline might be truncated or be rendered wrongly
            when there are too many separate highlight chunks. See |E541|.

            {options} is a dictionary with keys:
            `highlights`
            Optional~
            A dictionary whose values are |highlight-groups|. See
            |wilder-pipeline-result-draw| on how this dictionary is used.

            The default keys of the dictionary are:
                `default`
                Optional~
                The default highlight group used.

                Default: 'StatusLine'

                `selected`
                Optional~
                The highlight group used for a selected candidate.

                Default: 'WildMenu'

                `error`
                Optional~
                The highlight group used for the error message.

                Default: 'WildMenu'

                `separator`
                Optional~
                The highlight group used for the separators.

                Default: The same value as the `default` key

                `accent`
                Optional~
                The highlight group used for accents. See the `apply_accents`
                option.

                Default: The `default` highlight with |underline|

                `selected_accent`
                Optional~
                The highlight group used for accents for a selected candidate.
                See the `apply_accents` option.

                Default: The `selected` highlight with |underline|

            `separator`
            Optional~
            The separator between candidates.

            Default: '  '

            `ellipsis`
            Optional~
            The string to appended to a candidate if it is too long. The
            candidate is first truncated.

            Default: '...'

            `left`
            Optional~
            The component rendered on the left of the candidates.
            See |wilder-renderer-components|.

            Default: [wilder#previous_arrow()]

            `right`
            Optional~
            The component rendered on the right of the candidates.
            See |wilder-renderer-components|.

            Default: [wilder#next_arrow()]

            `apply_accents`
            Optional~
            A list of functions used to apply the `accent` and
            `selected_accent` highlights to a candidate. For convenience, also
            accepts a single function, which will be converted to a singleton
            list.

            Each function should take a {ctx}, {data} and {candidate} and
            return 0 when accents cannot be applied and return a list
            otherwise.
            The returned list should consist of [{start}, {end}] spans, where
            each span defines the start and end of part of the string to be
            highlighted.  {start} and {end} are inclusive.
            For multi-byte strings, the start and end are byte indices.
            The spans should be in strictly increasing order and should not
            overlap.

            For example, with {candidate} `abcdef` and result list [[0, 0],
            [3, 4]], the characters `a`, `d` and `e` will be highlighted with
            the `accent` or `selected_accent` highlights.

            Returning an empty list will result in no accent highlights.

            Each function of the list is applied in order, and the first
            non-0 result will be used to apply the higlights. If all functions
            return 0, no highlights will be applied.

            {ctx} contains no keys.

            {data} is the dictionary from |wilder-pipeline-result-data|.

            |wilder#python_pcre2_extract_captures()| is a helper function
            which can be used to apply accents to the capture groups when
            using |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()| and
            |wilder#python_search_pipeline()|.

            Example:
>
            call wilder#set_option('renderer', wilder#statusline_renderer({
                  \ 'separator':
                  \     funcref('wilder#python_pcre2_extract_captures'),
                  \ }))
<

            Deprecated: Use `highlights`.
            Optional~
            The default highlight group.

            Default: 'StatusLine'

            Optional~
            The highlight group for the selected candidate.

            Default: 'WildMenu'

            `error_hl`
            Deprecated: Use `highlights`.
            Optional~
            The highlight group of error messages.

            Default: 'StatusLine'

            `separator_hl`
            Deprecated: Use `highlights`.
            Optional~

wilder#float_renderer([{options}])  *wilder#float_renderer()*
                                    Neovim 0.4+ only~
                                    Renderer~
            Requires Neovim 0.4+ with |api-floatwin|. Returns a renderer which
            draws the results on a floating window just above the cmdline.
            Uses the same options as |wilder#statusline_renderer|.

COMPONENTS                          *wilder-renderer-components*
                                    *wilder-renderer-component*

Both |wilder#statusline_renderer()| and |wilder#float_renderer()| use the same
components.

Components can be of the following types:

            String:
            The value of the string will be drawn. To change its highlight
            group, see the entry for Dictionary.

            List:
            A list of |wilder-renderer-components|. Any component can be in
            the list, even other nested lists.
            Components of the list are drawn in sequence.

            Dictionary:
            A dictionary with the following keys:
                `value`
                Mandatory~
                A |wilder-renderer-component|. Can be nested.

                `len`
                Optional~
                Used to determine the display width taken up by the component.
                Can be of the following types:

                    Number:
                    The value of the number is used.

                    Function:
                    A function which takes a {ctx} and the pipeline result
                    {result} and returns the display width taken up by the
                    component.
                    The keys of {ctx} are the same as the ones in the `render`
                    key of |wilder-renderer|.

                Default: None

                `hl`
                Optional~
                The highlight group to use when drawing this component. Nested
                components can override this by defining their own `hl` key.

                Default: The `hl` option for the renderer.

                `pre_hook`
                Optional~
                A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
                wilder starts, or when wilder becomes unhidden. See
                |wilder-hidden|.

                {ctx} contains no keys.

                Default: None

                `post_hook`
                Optional~
                A function which takes a {ctx}. This function is called when
                wilder stops, or when wilder becomes hidden. See
                |wilder-hidden|.

                {ctx} contains no keys.

                Default: None

            Function:
            A function which takes a {ctx} and the pipeline result {result}
            and returns a component.

            The keys of {ctx} are the same as the ones in the `render`
            key of |wilder-renderer|, with an additional `page` key which is a
            2 element array [{start}, {end}] indicating the start and end of
            the candidates currently being drawn. If no candidates are drawn,
            the page is [-1, -1].

            Note: `ctx.page` is not available when determining the `len`
            of the component. This means components depending on
            `ctx.page` have to be wrapped in a dictionary and provide the
            `len` entry.

Before drawing the results, the amount of space available needs to be
calculated. This is done by calculating the total space taken by the
components, and then subtracting that from the total space available.

For String components, it is the |strdisplaywidth()| of the string.
For List components, it is the sum of the space used by the nested components.
For Dictionary components, if it has no `len` entry, the space taken by the
`value` entry is calculated. Otherwise, the `len` entry is used if it is a
Number, or if it is a function, the result of calling the `len` entry is used.
For Function components, the function is called, and the space used of the
result is calculated.

This means that when using Dictionary components, the `len` entry has to be
consistent with the `value` entry, otherwise the rendering will not be
correct.

When drawing the results, the components are evaluated.

For String components, the string itself is used.
For List components, each element is evaluated and then drawn in sequence.
For Dictionary components, the `value` entry is evaluated.
For Function components, the function is called, and its result evaluated.
If any of these result in another |wilder-renderer-component|, it is evaluated
again.

The default highlight group used for the result is the `hl` option passed to
the renderer. To change the highlight group, use a Dictionary component
together with |wilder#make_hl()|.

Here is the list of in-built components:

wilder#previous()                   *wilder#previous()*
            Select the previous completion candidate.

wilder#can_accept_completion()      *wilder#can_accept_completion()*
            Returns true if |wilder#in_context()| is true, and there is a
            completion which can be accepted.

wilder#can_reject_completion()      *wilder#can_reject_completion()*
            Returns true if |wilder#in_context()| is true, and there is a
            completion which can be rejected.

wilder#accept_completion()          *wilder#accept_completion()*
            Accepts the current completion. Mainly used when in |menus| in
            cmdline mode.

                                    Experimental~
            If {f} is not a function, calls {on_finish} with it if provided,
            otherwise calls |wilder#resolve()|.

            If {f} is a function, calls it as a |wilder-pipeline-thunk|. When
            the thunk resolves, it will call {on_finish} if provided,
            otherwise it calls |wilder#resolve()|. If there is an error, calls
            {on_error} if provided, otherwise it calls |wilder#reject()|.

            This can be used to wait for thunks within another thunk.
            Example:
>
            function! Foo(ctx, x) abort
              return wilder#wait(Bar, {ctx, result_of_bar ->

            Vim or Neovim version does not support the |CmdlineEnter| autocmd.

            Example:
>
            nnoremap <expr> / wilder#start_from_normal_mode() . '/'
            nnoremap <expr> : wilder#start_from_normal_mode() . ':'

wilder#make_hl({name}, {args}, [, {args1}, ..., {argsN}])
                                    *wilder#make_hl()*
            Helper function to create a highlight group. Creates a highlight
            group with the given {name} based on {args}.

            These highlight groups will be recreated each time wilder is
            started, or is unhidden (see |wilder-hidden|).

            Returns {name}.

            {args} can be of the types:

            String:
            A |:hi-link| is made to the given highlight group.

            List:
            The list should be of the form:
            [{term_hl}, {cterm_hl}, {guiterm_hl}]

            Each entry can be of the types:
                List:
                [{fg}, {bg}] or [{fg}, {bg}, {attr-list}]
                where {fg} and {bg} are numbers or strings, and {attr-list} is
                a list of strings.
                For {term_hl}, the first 2 elements are ignored.

                Example:
>
                call wilder#make_hl('MyHighlight', [
                    \ [0, 0, 'bold'],
                    \ [1, 2],

            Returns a fuzzy filter to use for `fuzzy_filter` in
            |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()|.
            The filter matches a {candidate} if it contains all the characters
            in {query} and in the same order.

            e.g. `foobar` will match `fbr`
                 `foobar` will not match `frb`

            Returns a fuzzy filter to use for `fuzzy_filter` in
            |wilder#cmdline_pipeline()|.
            The filter matches a {candidate} if it contains all the characters
            in {query} and in the same order.
            The filter uses Python 3. {engine} is the regex engine to use. Has
            to be compatible with Python 3's `re` module. Defaults to 're' if
            not set.


            e.g. `foobar` will match `fbr`
                 `foobar` will not match `frb`

                                    Python 3 fuzzywuzzy module required~
            Takes a list of candidates and a query and returns a
            |wilder-pipeline-thunk| which sorts the candidates using
            `fuzzywuzzy`.

            Example:
>
             wilder#result({'value': {ctx, xs ->
               wilder#python_fuzzywuzzy(ctx, xs, ctx.input)}}})

                                    Neovim only~
            Helper function for the `apply_accents` option for
            |wilder#statusline_renderer()| and |wilder#float_renderer()|.

            {data} should be a dictionary containing the key `pcre2_pattern`.
            The value of `pcre2_pattern` should be a PCRE2 pattern with
            capture groups. If the key is not found, returns 0.

            Otherwise, returns a list of [{start}, {end}] elements, where each
            element defines the start and end of a captured group. For
            multi-byte strings, the start and end are byte indices.

            Note: This function is slow and should be avoided by users who are
            concerned about performance. Use
            |wilder#lua_pcre2_extract_captures()| for slightly better
            performance.

                                    Lua pcre2 package required~
            Helper function for the `apply_accents` option for
            |wilder#statusline_renderer()| and |wilder#float_renderer()|.

            See |wilder#python_pcre2_extract_captures()|.

            The pcre2 package source can be found at
            `https://github.com/mah0x211/lua-pcre2` and can be installed with
            `luarocks install pcre2`.

            Note: This function is faster than
            |wilder#python_pcre2_extract_captures()| but is still slow and
            should be avoided by users who are concerned about performance.
